    <h2>How to make Raspberry Truffle Brownies</h2>
    <p>This recipe comes from an old cookbook of mine that some women in my church put together years ago.</p> 
    It’s one of my favorite cookbooks because so many of these women are fantastic cooks, and shared awesome recipes!</p> 
    <p>Whenever I’m wanting some new recipe inspiration, it’s one of the first I turn to.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>11/2 cups semi sweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/2 cup salted butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extrac</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Add chocolate chips and butter to a heavy saucepan over low heat. Stir constantly until melted and smooth. Remove from heat to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl beat to gather the brown sugar and eggs until well combined. </li>
        <li>Add melted chocolate mixture and vanilla and mix. Add flour and baking powder and mix. </li>
        <li>Spread batter evenly into the bottom of a lightly greased 8’’ or 9’’ square pan. </li>
        <li>Bake for 28-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the brownies comes out with few moist crumbs. Don’t overcook them or they won't be “fudgy”.</li>
    </ol>
