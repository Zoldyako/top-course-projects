    <h2>How to make Gingerbread Cookies</h2>
    <p>When I was young, we often decorated the “kids” Christmas tree with gingerbread cookies and it made the house smell amazing. This is the BEST recipe for soft, chewy gingerbread cookies.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup dark brown sugar , packed</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>12 Tablespoons butter , room temperature, cut into 12 pieces</li>
        <li>3/4 cup molasses (dark molasses)</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>PAdd flour, brown sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and salt to a mixing bowl and mix.</li>
        <li>Add the butter pieces and use a pastry blender to cut the butter in until the mixture resembles fine meal.</li>
        <li>With a mixer running on low speed gradually add the molasses and milk and mix until combined, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough in half, forming each into a ball. Wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight, or place in the freezer for about 20 minutes, until firm, if you’re in a hurry.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Remove one dough sheet from the fridge/freezer and place on the counter. Roll out the dough (use a little flour on your rolling pin if needed), until it’s about ½ inch thick. Cut gingerbread men and place them on prepared baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate the gingerbread men for 5 minutes (meanwhile you can roll out the other dough ball).</li>
        <li>Bake the cookies until set in the centers and the dough barely retains and imprint when touched very gently with fingertip, 8 to 11 minutes (depending on the size of your cookie cutter). Do not overbake!!</li>
        <li>Remove the cookies to a wire rack. Allow to cool to room temperature before frosting.</li>
        <li>Store gingerbread cookies in an airtight container with parchment paper between the layers. Freeze for up to 3 months.</li>
    </ol>
