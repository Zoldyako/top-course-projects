# odin-recipes
This project is a lesson at "The Odin Project" website.

In this lesson I'll be making a basic recipes site to introduce me to HTML!

When I finish this lesson I'll write down what I've learned:
- 
- Basic of git and github
- Basic of HTML and CSS
- Create a simple site with multiple pages
